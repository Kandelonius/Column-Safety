N-size Sudoku is a game with a square table of N2 width and height divided into N2 smaller
squares of N width and height. In a solved state, each of these smaller squares, as well
as each row and column of a full square, contains all numbers from 1 to N2 without repetition.

Given a number N on the first line and a full sudoku table on the next N2 lines. Every line
